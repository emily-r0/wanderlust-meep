# About Me

I'm a growing systems administrator and data scientist excited to dive further into coding 🌊 I have experience in R and Python, so I'm starting to dabble in SQL and SOQL, Salesforce's version.

🔭 I’m currently working on an interactive Python code that helps me pick which movie I should watch based on a database of titles and themes/categories. I'm also looking at pulling in more details for each movie through the TMDB API.

⚡ If I'm not at my desk, I'm probably at the archery range, in the moutains, or riding horses!
